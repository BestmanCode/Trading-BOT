# TradingBot
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ilcardella/TradingBot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ilcardella/TradingBot)  [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/tradingbot/badge/?version=latest)](https://tradingbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This is an attempt to create an autonomous market trading script using the IG
REST API and any other available data source for market prices.

TradingBot is meant to be a "forever running" process that keeps
analysing the markets and taking actions whether the conditions are met.
It is halfway from an academic project and a real useful piece of
software, I guess I will see how it goes :)

The main goal of this project is to provide the capability to
write a custom trading strategy with the minimum effort.
TradingBot handle all the boring stuff.

All the credits for the FAIG_iqr strategy goes to GitHub user @tg12
who is the creator of the first script version and gave me a good
starting point for this project. Thank you.

# Dependencies

- Python 3.4+

View file `requirements.txt` for the full list of dependencies.

# Setup

It is recommended to use a virtual environment or a Docker container (see below
for Docker instructions).

Install dependencies with pip
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Login to your IG Dashboard

- Obtain an API KEY from the settings panel
- If using the demo account, create demo credentials
- Take note of your spread betting account ID (demo or real)
- Visit AlphaVantage website: `https://www.alphavantage.co`
- Request a free api key
- Insert these info in a file called `.credentials`

This must be in json format
```
{
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "api_key": "apikey",
    "account_id": "accountId",
    "av_api_key": "apiKey"
}
```
- Copy the `.credentials` file in the `data` folder
- Revoke permissions to read the file if you are paranoid
```
cd data
sudo chmod 600 .credentials
```

### Market source

There are different ways to define which markets to analyse with TradinbgBot. You can select your preferred option in the `config.json` file with the `market_source` parameter:

- **Local file**

You can create a file `epic_ids.txt` containg IG epics of the companies you want to monitor.
You need to copy this file into the `data` folder.

- **Watchlist**

You can use an IG watchlist, TradingBot will analyse every market added to the selected watchlist

- **API**

TradingBot navigates the IG markets dynamically using the available API call to fetch epic ids.

### Configuration file

The `config.json` file is in the `config` folder and it contains several configurable parameter to personalise
how TradingBot work. These are the description of each parameter:

#### General

- **max_account_usable**: The maximum percentage of account funds to use (A safe value is around 50%)
- **time_zone**: The timezone to use (i.e. 'Europe/London)
- **enable_log**: Enable the log in a file rather than on stdout
- **log_file**: Define the full file path for the log file to use, if enabled. {home} and {timestamp} placeholders are replaced with the user home directory and the timestamp when TradingBot started
- **debug_log**: Enable the debug level in the logging
- **credentials_filepath**: Filepath for the `.credentials` file
- **market_source**: The source to use to fetch the market ids. Available values are explained in the `Setup` section below.
- **epic_ids_filepath**:  The full file path for the local file containing the list of epic ids
- **watchlist_name**: The watchlist name to use as market source, if selected
- **active_strategy**: The strategy name to use. Must match one of the names in the `Strategies` section below

#### IG Interface

- **order_type**: The IG order type (MARKET, LIMIT, etc.). Do NOT change it
- **order_size**: The size of the spread bets
- **order_expiry**: The order expiry (DFB). Do NOT change it
- **order_currency**: The currency of the order (For UK shares leave it as GBP)
- **order_force_open**: Force to open the orders
- **use_g_stop**: Use guaranteed stops. Read IG terms for more info about them.
- **use_demo_account**: Trade on the DEMO IG account. If enabled remember to setup the demo account credentials too
- **controlled_risk**: Enable the controlled risk stop loss calculation. Enable only if you have a controlled risk account.
- **paper_trading**: Enable the `paper trading`. No real trades will be done on the IG account.

#### Alpha Vantage

- **enable**: Enable the use of AlphaVantage API
- **api_timeout**: Timeout in seconds between each API call

#### Strategies

Settings specific for each strategy

#### SimpleMACD

- **spin_interval**: Override the `Strategies` value
- **max_spread_perc**: Spread percentage to filter markets with high spread
- **limit_perc**: Limit percentage to take profit for each trade
- **stop_perc**: Stop percentage to stop any loss

# Run

TradingBot can be controlled by the `trading_bot_ctl` shell script.
The script provides several commands to perform different actions:

### Start TradingBot
:
```
./trading_bot_ctl start
```

### Stop TradingBot

```
./trading_bot_ctl stop
```

### Close all the open positions

```
./trading_bot_ctl close_positions
```

# Test

If you have setup a virtual environment you can run the test by running `pytest` from the project root folder.

You can run the test from a clean environment with:
```
./trading_bot_ctl test
```

You can run the test in Docker containers against different python versions:
```
./trading_bot_ctl test_docker
```

# Documentation

The Sphinx documentation contains further details about each TradingBot module
with source code documentation of each class member.
Explanation is provided regarding how to create your own Strategy and how to integrate
it with the system.

Read the documentation at:

https://tradingbot.readthedocs.io

You can build it locally with:
```
./trading_bot_ctl docs
```

The generated html files will be in `doc/_build/html`.

# Automate

**NOTE**: TradingBot monitors the market opening hours and suspend the trading when the market is closed. Generally you should NOT need a cron job!

You can set up the crontab job to run and kill TradinBot at specific times.
The only configuration required is to edit the crontab file adding the preferred schedule:
```
crontab -e
```
As an example this will start TradingBot at 8:00 in the morning and will stop it at 16:35 in the afternoon, every week day (Mon to Fri):
```
00 08 * * 1-5 /.../TradingBot/trading_bot_ctl start
35 16 * * 1-5 /.../TradingBot/trading_bot_ctl stop
```
NOTE: Remember to set the correct timezone in your machine!

# Docker
You can run TradingBot in a Docker container (https://docs.docker.com/):
```
./trading_bot_ctl start_docker
```
The container will be called `dkr_trading_bot` and the logs will still be stored in the configured folder in the host machine. By default `~/.TradingBot/log`.

To stop TradingBot just kill the container:
```
docker kill dkr_trading_bot
```

If you need to start a bash shell into the container
```
docker exec -it dkr_trading_bot bash
```
